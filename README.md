# bus_power

This printed circuit board provides the ability to connect
up to two separate batteries to the bus -- one for powering
logic and the other for powering motors.  The board has
polarity protection circuitry to deal with accidentally
connecting the power up backwards.  In addition there are
some polyfuses (kind of like circuit breakers) that protect
against accidental shorts.

There is a nifty
[YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrB-FPcv1Dc)
that explains how a P-channel MOSFET polarity protection cirucit
works.
